#### Hi, I'm June.

> A multidisciplinary creative technologist building tools, engines, and moments of clarity through code and design.
> 
> I'm a systems thinker and creative builder. I write Rust, C++, Web 4+, Python; I design custom game engines, bespoke GUI tools, stable CLI tools (Linux philosophy), and creative interactive systems. I prioritize minimalism, clarity, and user resonance in every tool I craft.

### ðŸŒ¿ Projects
> - **[GammaRelay Applet](https://github.com/junelva/wl-gammarelay-applet)** â€“ A DBus-connected Wayland tool ([see config logic](https://github.com/junelva/wl-gammarelay-applet/blob/main/src/main.rs#L29-L73)) for managing display settings with CLI flags and smooth delta state syncing.
> - **[queer folk farm-punk](https://github.com/junelva/qffp)** â€“ Tiny, expressive pixel games running in the terminal; what's not to love?
> - **[shecv](https://github.com/junelva/shecv)** â€“ One of many experimental miniature game engines built in Rust, this time demonstrating `wgpu` working with `SDL`.

### Philosophy
> I design software the way poets  lay stone pathsâ€”carefully, with attention to sensation and continuity. Tools should ask little, give much, and weave interaction into presence.

### Tech Stack
I have and continue to work with a variety of tools and disciplines: `Rust`, `C++`, `Python`, `Linux`, `Web Frontend`, `Custom Engines`, `Procedural Art`, `Unreal`, `Jenkins`, `Automated Testing`, `Continuous Integration`, `Unity`, `Godot`, `Blender`, `Wayland`, `Embedded Systems`, `Design`, all with a decade-long background in visual arts for film and interactive media.
